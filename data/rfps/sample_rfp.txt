Request for Proposals â€“ Evaluation Criteria for Electronic Health Record (EHR) Modernization

The following criteria will be used to evaluate vendor submissions for the design, implementation, and support of a modernized Electronic Health Record (EHR) system. Proposals will be assessed on both qualitative and quantitative measures. Each criterion is weighted equally unless otherwise noted.

1. Solution Fit
The degree to which the proposed EHR platform meets the functional and non-functional requirements specified in the RFP. This includes configurability, modularity, clinical workflow alignment, and support for both primary and specialty care.

2. Technical Architecture
Assessment of the proposed system architecture, including modular design, scalability, interoperability (e.g., HL7/FHIR), security, performance, and alignment with industry best practices for healthcare IT.

3. Cost
Evaluation of total cost of ownership, including licensing, implementation, maintenance, support, data migration, and training. Transparency of pricing model, scalability of costs, and any hidden fees will be reviewed.

4. Implementation Timeline
Feasibility of the proposed implementation plan, including phases, milestones, resources, and dependencies. Consideration will be given to vendor capacity, risk mitigation strategies, and past delivery performance.

5. Vendor Experience
Experience and track record of the vendor in delivering similar solutions in healthcare environments. References, case studies, certifications, and qualifications of key team members will be taken into account.

6. Risk Management
Identification and mitigation of key project risks including data security, privacy, compliance (e.g., HIPAA/PHIPA), system availability, and vendor lock-in. Proposals should include a risk register and risk response plan.
