def run_full_report_review(agent, report_sections, max_steps=5):
    """
    Conducts a full review of an IT consulting report using the ReAct framework.

    Purpose:
    This function iterates through all sections of an IT consulting report, performing a reasoning and action loop for each section using the ReAct framework. It then performs post-processing steps to highlight missing sections, generate a final summary, and extract the top issues.

    Parameters:
    agent (ReActConsultantAgent): An instance of the ReActConsultantAgent class, initialized with the section name and text.
    report_sections (dict): A dictionary where keys are section headers and values are the corresponding section contents.
    max_steps (int): The maximum number of steps to run the loop for each section. Default is 5.

    Workflow:
    1. Iterates through each section in the report_sections dictionary.
    2. For each section:
       - Sets the agent's section_name and section_text attributes.
       - Calls the run_react_loop_check_withTool function to perform the reasoning and action loop.
    3. After processing all sections, performs post-processing steps:
       - Calls highlight_missing_sections to identify any missing sections in the report.
       - Calls generate_final_summary to generate a final summary of the report.
       - Calls extract_top_issues to identify the top issues or gaps in the report.
    4. Stores the results of the post-processing steps in the agent's memory.

    Returns:
    ReActConsultantAgent: The agent instance with updated memory containing the results of the full report review.

def summarize_full_review(agent):
    """
    Summarizes the full review of an IT consulting report.

    Purpose:
    This function consolidates the feedback from all reviewed sections of an IT consulting report and generates a final summary. The summary highlights the overall quality of the report, identifies gaps, strengths, and suggests next steps for improvement.

    Parameters:
    agent (ITReportReviewer): An instance of the ITReportReviewer class, which contains the review history for each section.

    Workflow:
    1. Initializes an empty string `combined_review_text` to store the consolidated feedback.
    2. Iterates through the `review_history` attribute of the `agent` object.
       - For each review, appends the section name and feedback to `combined_review_text`.
    3. Constructs a prompt for the OpenAI API to summarize the overall quality of the report.
       - The prompt includes the consolidated feedback and instructions to highlight gaps, strengths, and next steps.
    4. Calls the OpenAI API using the `call_openai_with_tracking` function to generate the summary.
    5. Returns the generated summary.

    Returns:
    str: A summary of the overall quality of the report, including gaps, strengths, and suggested next steps.
