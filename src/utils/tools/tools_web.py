    Parameters:
    query (str): The search query to find relevant information.
    max_results (int): The maximum number of search results to retrieve. Default is 1.

    Workflow:
    1. Initializes a DuckDuckGo search session using DDGS.

    3. Iterates through the search results and returns the snippet of the first result.
    4. If no results are found, returns a message indicating no relevant results were found.
    5. If an exception occurs during the search, returns a message indicating the web search failed along with the exception message.

    Searches the web for relevant information using SerpAPI.

    Purpose:
    This function uses the SerpAPI to perform a web search based on a given query. It retrieves the top result, extracts relevant metadata (title, URL, snippet), and stores the result in the agent's memory for future reference.

    Parameters:
    query (str): The search query to find relevant information.

    Workflow:
    1. Calls the `run` method of the `serpapi` object to perform the search.

    3. If results are found:
       - Extracts the title, URL, and snippet of the top result.
       - Stores the metadata in the agent's memory under the "citations" key, categorized by the section name.
       - Returns a formatted string containing the title, URL, and snippet of the top result.
    4. If no results are found, returns a message indicating no web results were found.
    5. If an exception occurs during the search, catches the exception and returns an error message.

    Returns:
    str: A formatted string containing the title, URL, and snippet of the top result, or a message indicating no results were found or an error occurred.

    Determines whether academic research or scientific citations could enhance the credibility of a report section.

    Purpose:
    This function evaluates a given section of an IT consulting report to decide if referencing academic research or scientific citations would improve its credibility. It uses an AI model to analyze the section and provide a decision along with a reason.

    Parameters:
    section_text (str): The text of the section to be evaluated.
    model (str): The name of the AI model to use for evaluation. Default is "gpt-3.5-turbo".

    Workflow:
    1. Constructs a prompt instructing the AI model to analyze the section and determine if academic research would enhance its credibility.
    2. Sends the prompt to the AI model using the `call_openai_with_tracking` function.
    3. Extracts the decision (YES or NO) and the reason from the AI model's response using regular expressions.
    4. If the decision or reason cannot be extracted, defaults to "NO" with a generic reason.
    5. Returns the decision as a boolean and the reason as a string.

    Returns:
    tuple:
        - bool: `True` if academic research is recommended, `False` otherwise.
