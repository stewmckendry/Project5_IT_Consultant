# 🚀 Future Directions for RFP & Proposal Evaluation System

This document captures forward-looking enhancements to make the system more robust, flexible, and intelligent.

---

## 🧠 1. LLM-Based Section Detection
**Goal:** Reliably identify RFP sections (e.g., Background, Requirements, Evaluation Criteria, etc.) regardless of their formatting or titles.

### Why:
- RFPs vary in structure and language.
- Regex-based parsing breaks with novel formatting.

### Approach:
Use an LLM to label sections with:
- `name` (normalized label)
- `start` / `end` position in text
- `1-line description`

### Example Output:
```json
{
  "name": "Evaluation Criteria",
  "start": 1532,
  "end": 2783,
  "description": "Describes the criteria used to score vendor proposals"
}
```

## 🔍 2. LLM-Based Evaluation Criteria Extraction
**Goal:** Extract structured evaluation criteria from unstructured or semi-structured RFP language.

### Why:
- Criteria are often embedded in paragraphs, not clear bullets.
- Weighting and expectations vary in format.

### Desired Output:
```json
{
  "criterion_id": "solution_fit",
  "original_label": "Solution Alignment",
  "weight": 25,
  "description": "How well the proposed solution meets our requirements.",
  "response_expectations": "Describe how your solution meets each requirement."
}
```

## 🧩 3. Normalized RFP Schema
**Goal:** Enable consistent downstream processing by standardizing extracted sections and criteria.

### Benefits:
- Tool routing by criterion
- Automated comparison across proposals
- Traceability (criteria → section → score)

---

## 🔄 4. Hybrid Parsing Strategy
Combine:
- 🧮 **Heuristics**: pattern-based rules for things like percentages, titles, and known bullet markers.
- 🤖 **LLMs**: handle fuzzier interpretation (semantic similarity, inferred relationships).

---

## 🧰 5. Related Enhancements

- Support ambiguous proposal structure via semantic section matching
- Integrate proposal + RFP lineage trace (requirement → solution → timeline → cost)
- Handle multi-doc RFP packages (e.g., addenda, technical specs)
- Dynamic rerouting of tools based on missing or weak data
