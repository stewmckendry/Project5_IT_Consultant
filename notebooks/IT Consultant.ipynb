    "    Runs the ReAct (Reason + Act) loop for a specified number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Purpose:\n",
    "    This function iterates through a reasoning and action loop using the ReAct framework to review a section of an IT consulting report. It generates thoughts, actions, and observations at each step, and stores the history of these steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Parameters:\n",
    "    agent (ReActConsultantAgent): An instance of the ReActConsultantAgent class, initialized with the section name and text.\n",
    "    max_steps (int): The maximum number of steps to run the loop. Default is 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Workflow:\n",
    "    1. Iterates through the loop for a maximum of `max_steps` times.\n",
    "    2. In each iteration:\n",
    "       - Calls `agent.build_react_prompt()` to construct the prompt for the ReAct framework.\n",
    "       - Calls `call_openai_with_tracking()` to get the response from the OpenAI API.\n",
    "       - Parses the response to extract the thought and action.\n",
    "       - Generates an observation based on the action.\n",
    "       - Stores the thought, action, and observation in the agent's history.\n",
    "       - Prints the result of the current step.\n",

    "    4. Iterates through each upgraded section:\n",
    "       - Adds the section name as a subheader.\n",

    "       - If footnotes are available, appends a list of footnotes with the original text, improved text, and reason for the improvement.\n",
    "    5. Joins the list of lines into a single markdown-formatted string.\n",
