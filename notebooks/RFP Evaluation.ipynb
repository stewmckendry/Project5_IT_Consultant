      "🧠 Thoughts:\n",
      "   • How does Vendor A address potential risks related to data security and privacy in their cloud-native EHR platform, especially considering the sensitive nature of healthcare data?\n",
      "   • How does Vendor A ensure compliance with relevant data security and privacy regulations, such as HIPAA or GDPR, in their cloud-native EHR platform?\n",
      "🛠️ Tools Used:\n",
      "   • check_guideline[\"data security\"]: ⚠️ Tool execution error: check_guideline_dynamic() missing 1 required positional argument: 'agent'\n",
      "   • search_web[\"HIPAA compliance in healthcare data management\"]: Step 2: Depending on the size of your data load and the complexity of your operations, the HIPAA compliance officer or a hired specialist will need to perform a thorough HIPAA risk assessment and create a risk management plan based on those findings.. In small to medium enterprises, your IT administrator should be capable of conducting this assessment with their team, under the guidance of ...\n",

      "   • search_report[\"encryption methods\"]: The term 'encryption methods' was NOT found anywhere in the report.\n",
      "🗣️ Explanation: The proposal mentions the importance of data security and privacy in passing, but does not provide detailed information on how Vendor A addresses these risks in their cloud-native EHR platform. More specific details on security features, encryption methods, access controls, and compliance with regulations like HIPAA or GDPR would be needed to fully evaluate their risk management practices.\n",
