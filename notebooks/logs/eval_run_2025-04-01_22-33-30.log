[22:34:30] [INFO] 📌 ✅ Summary of evaluations: **Final Comparison Summary:**

After carefully evaluating the proposals from Vendor A and Vendor B for the IT system, it is evident that both vendors have their strengths and weaknesses.

**Vendor B** demonstrated strengths in highlighting key aspects such as reliability, 24/7 support, and premium features. However, there were weaknesses in the lack of specific details on solution fit and cost, which could pose a threat to winning the client's trust and interest.

**Vendor A** showcased strengths in mentioning that their product solves the stated problem and is easy to install and use, along with competitive pricing. Nevertheless, the proposal lacked specific details on performance, security, trust, and customization options, as well as transparency in pricing.

Vendor A:
